# AcuScan
Hospital Management system with 4 types of users and guest: Doctor, technical, receptionist, and Admin and patient the system has one more part which is the computer vision model which deals with X-Ray chest and diagnose them based on NIH chest-Xrays and reported also by the model and allowing to thew doctor to work fast in small time to review these reports

# AcuScan-Model 
The chest X-ray is one of the most commonly accessible radiological examinations for screening and diagnosis of many lung diseases.
A tremendous number of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are accumulated and stored in many modern hospitalsâ€™ Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS).
On the other side, it is still an open question how this type of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable imaging informatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry deep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision computeraided diagnosis (CAD) systems.
