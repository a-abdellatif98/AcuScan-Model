The chest X-ray is one of the most commonly accessi-
ble radiological examinations for screening and diagnosis
of many lung diseases. A tremendous number of X-ray
imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are
accumulated and stored in many modern hospitalsâ€™ Pic-
ture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). On
the other side, it is still an open question how this type
of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable
imaging informatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to fa-
cilitate the data-hungry deep learning paradigms in build-
ing truly large-scale high precision computer-aided diagno-
sis (CAD) systems.
